# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Environment variables

The application expects `PRIVATE_API_BASE_URL` to be available at build and runtime.
When deploying with Firebase Hosting, you can provide it in `firebase.json` under
`hosting.build.env` and in `apphosting.yaml` under `runConfig.env`.
